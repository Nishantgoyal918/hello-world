Starting with GitHub.

Hi Everyone!

I myself Nishant Goyal a first-year undergraduate student of Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur of its Mathematics department, enrolled in its 5 years integrated master's of science course of Mathematics and Computing. This is my first GitHub file and with this I am starting my journey of open-source coding.
